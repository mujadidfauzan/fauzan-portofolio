    - Top Level â€“ Contains the lifting mechanism, which operates using a lead screw to convert rotational motion into linear motion for lifting the trolley.
    Robot Analysis

    Initially, the lifting mechanism had two supports, but this caused instability and frequent jamming. The design was revised, replacing the two supports with four supports for better balance. Additionally, bolts were replaced with 3mm shafts and linear bearings, ensuring smoother movement and preventing jams.`,
